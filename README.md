### **Who dis?**  
  

*I'm still finding out more and more every day. An independent thinker, conflicting in many ways both pessimistic and and idealist. I like to let it all out in any way possible whether it be through coding front end  
work or back end work or planning architecture or discovering the magic of AI and python. I also like painting and never gave myself credit enough to show that side to others but it feels good so why not?  
  I love creating with authenticity.  
    looking to build something great.  
      always looking for.  
        a great.  
          cause*
