# üñ±Ô∏è Welcome to my safe space
  
## **Who is Michael Albert?**
  üßî üéâ big enthusiast of being a part of the community and exploring new tech through multiple different lenses with a large emphasis on test automation and QA. I think being a well rounded engineer is important by learning up and coming technologies as well as maintaining skills in different parts of an application. Some of my future goals in tech are to get more familiar with using next.js's more advanced features that are not just simple cli or ui commands. It feels like cheating for some reason. I'll be posting various works of technical blogs as well as blogs focused on working in tech with adhd and how to not overwork yourself but stay productive, small web apps as learning tools and to showcase my creativity, vs-code extensions, chrome extensions, and when I can lower my ambition a little I would like to polish up and post some games as well.
